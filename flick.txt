There are two code tests:

First test (React.js) is essential.  But second test(Speed test) is optional.  If you don’t have enough time, please just do first test and submit.  Second test is optional.


1. Essential test - React.js

From the Flickr public JSON, show the results in real time as the user types the search term, including the following information:

• the image

• the author

• the tags

• link thumbnail to hi-resolution image

Use the Flickr public JSON feed found here - https://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public/

Note: For JSON data, you need to call this API with “format=json” query parameter

You can choose any framework, but If you are using React.js, please use it with Redux.

I encourage you to use ES6 or Typescript.

2. Optional test - SpeedTest

Please download the below JS file and change codes to achieve goal.

https://drive.google.com/open?id=1q57NArFucFWImuk-g2WUTLv-K56MXU-7

These codes runs the download simulator, and calculate the average download speed.

The goal is, ignore the first 2 seconds and last 2 seconds data, then calculate the average download speed 



You can push the codes into Github or Bitbucket and share the repository URL.

Could you please let me know when you can submit this?

There is no due date, but the earlier will be preferred.
